# AdvancedAI

Repository for the semester project of Advanced AI made by Elias Christmas

## Repository layout

the repository has 2 folders, and this readme file.

One folder contains the research files (data files and notebooks) that I used along the way in this project to try different methods.

the other folder is called COVID-19 and contains 3 subfolders, one for the data that includes the csv file storing the data, one the other is called model that includes the official submitted jupyter notebook and the third contains 6 screenshots of correct predictions on new unseen.

## Guide to using the project

### 1. Locating the correct file

the correct notebook can be found in the COVID-19 folder and is named "COVID-19.ipynb".

### 2. using the notebook

Once the notebook is opened, run all the cells in chronological order.

In step 5 and 6 of the notebook you will find cells that include code to calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score all shown in a classification report.

At the bottom of the notebook, in the last cell, you will find the code creating the Gradio App, you can use the app in the notebook in the output field or you can click on the link (available for 1 week) to open it in the browser.
