# AdvancedAI

Repository for the semester project of Advanced AI made by Elias Christmas.

## Repository layout

The repository has 2 folders, and this readme file.

One folder contains the research files (data files and notebooks) that I used along the way in this project to try different methods.

The other folder is called COVID-19 and contains 3 subfolders, one for the data that includes the csv file, one is called model that includes the official submitted jupyter notebook and the third contains 6 screenshots of correct predictions on new unseen tweets.

## Guide to using the project

### 1. Locating the correct file

The correct notebook can be found in the COVID-19 folder and is named "COVID-19.ipynb".

### 2. using the notebook

Once the notebook is opened, run all the cells from top to bottom.

In step 5 and 6 of the notebook you will find cells that include code to calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and a classification report.

At the bottom of the notebook, in the last cell, you will find the code creating the Gradio App, to open it in the browser click on the link (available for 1 week) or use the app in the output field.
